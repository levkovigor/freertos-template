# FreeRTOS Template Repository 
This repository is a template for projects that indicates how to produce, test and run arbitrary software based on the FreeRTOS real time operating system on the AT91SAM9G20-EK evaluation board. It uses the AT91LIB.

## TODO file
In the TODO.org file you shall find plenty of detail on the workflow
used for the production of a software.

The level of detail is intended to be good with the goal to provide a quick start for programmers with that have minimal tools and little experience.

The application is trivial in this case but demonstrates fundamental
aspects of software productions for the board.
