**** Abstract
     Our goal is to make a led blink with the AT91SAM9G20-EK board using
     FreeRTOS and ISIS static libraries.
     
     In order to achieve this we need to compile ISIS'port of FreeRTOS
     realtime operating system and other libraries, write a blinky
     program, compile it, flash it and verify our software.

     Our standard programming language is the C programming language
     with the C99 standard.

     The FreeRTOS real time operating system is widely used and
     documentation on it is extensive. FreeRTOS is not entirely
     architecture indepent this is why we need a port for some
     specific files to work with our particular Î¼-controller.
     
     Fortunately FreeRTOS has been ported to work with our target
     microcontroller by ISIS.

     Thourough tests have been carried out by ISIS, we need only to
     make a functional test of FreeRTOS tasks.

     We will base ourselfs on the ISIS FirstProject that to be used as
     a template for new projects and rewrite the program.
     
* Notes
  You shall note that AT91LIB distributed by ISIS has been used. The
  startup file has been patched to load FreeRTOS callbacks on
  exception handlers in src/boot_fstartup.S .
  
  As well, to improve portability some scripts where re-written in
  bash i.e. debug.pl.
  
  The following makefile targets : jlink, flashing, connect are only
  for convenience and call scripts for, respectively, start a j-link
  communication, flashing the board and connecting to the debug
  port. These scripts use third party software and should be adapted
  according to your usage an set-up. They are included only for
  convenience.

  In order to run the program you can connect through j-link, run the
  jlink server and type make debug_sdram and type continue on through
  GDB.
